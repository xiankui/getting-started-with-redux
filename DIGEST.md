# Learn Redux Step by Step

React: respond or behave in a particular way in response to something. (from translate.google.cn)
以**特定**的方式对**某些东西**作出**回应或行为**。

Redux (revived 满血复活) is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps.

## there principles of redux
* The Single Immutable State Tree (单一的不可变的状态树)
* Describing State Changes with Actions (用actions来描述状态的改变)
* The Reducer Function return the new state (reducer函数产生新的状态)

## store has 3 important methods:
* getState() to get the current state
* dispatch() to get a new state (or change the state)
* subscribe() everytime dispatch, subscribe is called

## Reducer Composition with Arrays
* split complex array state to litte.
* combine them with the same action that pass down.
* the aim is make reducer more smaller and readable.

##  Reducer Composition with Objects
* that must! remember, we can have one state only!
* once dispatch an action, every child reducer called to return a child state and then combine to the root state.
* so, different team members can work on different reducers that work with the same action.

## Implementing createStore from Scratch
```
const createStore = (reducer) => {
  let state;
  let listeners = [];

  const getState = () => state;

  const dispatch = (action) => {
    state = reducer(state, action);
    listeners.forEach(listener => listener());
  };

  const subscribe = (listener) => {
    listeners.push(listener);
    return () => {
      listeners = listeners.filter(l => l !== listener);
    }
  };

  dispatch({}); // dummy dispatch

  return { getState, dispatch, subscribe };

};
```

## Implementing combineReducers from Scratch
```
const combineReducers = reducers => {
  return (state = {}, action) => {

    // Reduce all the keys for reducers from `todos` and `visibilityFilter`
    return Object.keys(reducers).reduce(
      (nextState, key) => {
        // Call the corresponding reducer function for a given key
        nextState[key] = reducers[key] (
          state[key],
          action
        );
        return nextState;
      },
      {} // The `reduce` on our keys gradually fills this empty object until it is returned.
    );
  };
};
```

## Implementing Provider from scratch
```
class Provider extends Component {
  getChildContext() {
    return {
      store: this.props.store // This corresponds to the `store` passed in as a prop
    };
  }
  render() {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}

Provider.childContextTypes = {
  store: React.PropTypes.object
}
```

## magic connect
* connect state and dispatch to container component as explicitly props.
* everytime dispatch happend, re-called mapStateToProps; if the bind state changed, re-render the container component.
